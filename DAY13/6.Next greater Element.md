# Ques 7: Next greater element

## Brute
### steps: 
* Create an answer array
* Traverse the array
* for each element, traverse from i+1 to last and whenever you'll get element greater than the current, push it in answer and break;

## Optimal
### Steps: 
```abbrev: nge- next greater element```
* Create a stack and create an answer array
* Traverse from last to first element
* If the stack is empty then nge for current element will be the element itself and then push it into the stack
* If the stack already has elements then compare and find out if the stack's element is smaller then the current element of an array, if it is then pop it out until the top element of stack becomes greater then the current element of an array, and now top element of the stack would be nge for current element of an array, place it in answer array then push the current element of array in stack
* if the current element is lesser than the top of the stack then top of the stack woud be nge for current element so place it in answer and then push the current element of the array into the stack.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int n = nums.size();
        //you need a stack and an aswer vector to return named nge
        //nge is initialized with -1 because if we don't have any next greater element then we will return -1
        stack<int> st;
        vector<int> nge(n, -1);
        
        
        //start traverse from last, that is why n-1
        for(int i=(n-1); i>=0; i--){
            //remove those elements from stack which has lesser value than the current array value because they would not be needed
            while(!st.empty() && st.top()<=nums[i])
                st.pop();
            //if there is element in the top of stack then that surely would be nge
            //if stack is empty then there is no nge present so leave it, as vector already contains -1
           
                if(!st.empty()) nge[i]=st.top();
      
            //push the current number in stack for next iteration
            st.push(nums[i]);
        }
        return nge;
        
    }
};
```


## Ques: What if you are told that find the next greater element and if the next greater element is not present in the right of an array then search it in the left of the array
So this is the same kind of a problem but the array got converted into circular array, i.e if answer is not in left then you have to search it from the start of the array i.e starting from 0th index.

## Solution:
Just make another copy of the same array at the end of an original tray and implement the same process which you did in the last question.

Now you don't exactly need to create a new array, just have to use modulo to traverse it in a circular way. You jsut need to write your for loop from 0 to 2n-1 and use the modulo as explained below

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int n = nums.size();
        //you need a stack and an aswer vector to return called nge
        //nge is initialized with -1 because if we don't have any next greater element then we will return -1
        stack<int> st;
        vector<int> nge(n, -1);
        
        //assume you have two arrays, no need to atatch a new array
        //you can create an effect by using modulo
        //traverse from last, for two arrays that is why 2*n-1
        for(int i=(2*n-1); i>=0; i--){
            //remove those elements from stack which has lesser value than the current array value because they would not be needed
            while(!st.empty() && st.top()<=nums[i%n])
                st.pop();
            //here i is less than n because we just want to find nge for original elements and not the copied one
            //if there is element in the top of stack then that surely would be nge
            //if stack is empty then there is no nge present so leave it, as vector already contains -1
            if(i<n){
                if(!st.empty()) nge[i]=st.top();
            }
            //push the current number in stack for next iteration
            st.push(nums[i%n]);
        }
        return nge;
        
    }
};
```
